This is a readme file for the  AirBnB clone project which is a full web application
Here we will build a console first to enable us do various thing such as create class or new objects or even retrieve objects among mmany other operations.
This is a base for which other parts willl be built on.

To begin the project:
One is to clone a repository to machine from a created remote repo.
Change directory into the AirBnB clone and git checkout to the new branch to begin writing algorithms.
